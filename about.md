# About Me

Recently completed a PhD in Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLEDs) at Durham University.

Currently awaiting graduation and applying for research jobs.

Primarily using this blog as a method for documenting my attempts to learn more about programming and hardware engineering whilst carrying out different projects that interest me.
