The majority of the rest of the blog was produced using the documentation on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in conjuction with the [Andrew Munsell tutorial](http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial).
The search bar was modified from [Dave Taylor's site](http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_can_i_add_a_google_search_box_to_my_web_site/) whilst the tag and category search function was modified from [Alex Pearce's site](https://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching/).
Finally, the next and previous post buttons were adapted from [David Elbe's site](http://david.elbe.me/jekyll/2015/06/20/how-to-link-to-next-and-previous-post-with-jekyll.html) and my favicon was generated using [Favic-o-matic](http://www.favicomatic.com/).
